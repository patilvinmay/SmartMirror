# SmartMirror
Our final year project "Smart Mirror".<br>
After done with hardware part of our project we started with software part.<br>
We used weather api to get current weather of city, news api to get news from Times Of India.<br>
If you want to add music of your own then add to the main directory were practise.py lies.<br>
The UI is made so that it can be used from touch screen(IR Frame in our case).<br>
The file "practise.py" is the main file which has all the code that runs UI. <br>
Code is not very efficient and may have few bugs.<br>
Many different libraries are used to make the program including pyqt5 and pygame.<br>
As the Smart mirror should be reflective the background of UI is kept black.<br>
